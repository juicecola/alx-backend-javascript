0x02. ES6 classes
ES6 classes, introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), are a way to create reusable and structured object-oriented code in JavaScript. They provide a more formal and convenient syntax for creating constructor functions and managing inheritance. ES6 classes make it easier to work with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles within JavaScript.
