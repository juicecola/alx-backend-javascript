0x05. NodeJS Basics
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server-side, outside of a web browser. It's built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers Google Chrome, and provides a platform for building various types of applications, including web servers, command-line tools, APIs, and more.
